# Polus core 

Here we describe operations that are used through all packages 
of this toolkit.

Furthermore, the package core has module-wide variables that 
govern some internal behaviour of this framework. For instance, 
polus.core has a jit_compile attribute that controls 
the utilization of XLA during the code conversion to static 
computational graphs, the correct way to write or read this 
attribute is through its associated methods:

```python

from polus.core import set_jit_compile, get_jit_compile

print(get_jit_compile()) # True
set_jit_compile(False) #False
print(get_jit_compile()) # False

```
